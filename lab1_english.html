                <h4>Formation</h4>
                He was born in the family of bricklayer Pavlo Petrovych Lozovyaga. Mother - Yevdokia Ivanivna Kryvusha - came from a wealthy peasant family from the village of Kuzemin near Okhtyrka. In addition to Ivan, a son, Fedir, and two daughters, Neonila and Elizaveta, were brought up in the family.

                At the age of six, he began studying at a church parish school, then graduated from the higher elementary school in Okhtyrka. In 1920, he entered the technical school of metalwork, then - the Krasnopil School of Art and Ceramics.

                In 1922, a period of work activity and an active social and political life began: he was a foreman of a sugar factory, then a district police inspector in the Okhtyr militia, then a drawing teacher in a colony for homeless people and orphans. In 1925, he left the Komsomol. In order to "enrich with impressions" (as Ivan Bagryany said), he visited the Donbass, the Crimea, and the Kuban.

                In 1925, Ivan worked in Kamianets-Podilskyi as an illustrator in the newspaper "Chervony Kordon", and printed his first poems in it.
                In the same year, 1925, under the pseudonym I. Polarny, he self-published a small collection "Black Silhouettes: Five Stories" in Okhtyrka. The stories describe impressions of what the author saw and experienced during his trip to Ukraine. These are mainly joyless realistic pictures of the life of the society of that time.

                In 1926, he entered the Kyiv Art Institute (KHI), which he could not graduate due to financial difficulties and the prejudiced attitude of the management. While studying at the KHI, he left the "Plow" union, joined the opposition literary association MARS ("Workshop of the Revolutionary Word"), where he became close to self-demanding artists of the word: Valerian Pidmogilny, Yevhen Pluzhnyk, Boris Antonenko-Davydovich, Hryhoriy Kosynka, Todosem Osmachka and others, who were later subjected to devastating criticism by official Soviet critics and persecuted in every possible way. It was then that Ivan Bagryany actively worked and was published in the magazines "Globus", "Vsesvit", "Life and Revolution", "Red Way" and others.
                In the 1920s, he published a number of poetic works: a collection of poems "To the limits of the ordered", the poems "Mongolia", "Vandea", "Gazavat", the play "Lilac" about graphomaniacs. In 1929, he published the verse poem "Ave Maria" at his own expense, which was almost immediately banned by the censors and removed from bookstores.

                In 1930, the historical novel in verse "Skelka" was published. It tells about the uprising in the village of Skelka in the 18th century. against the arbitrariness of the Moscow monks of the nearby monastery. The peasants burned the monastery, protesting against national oppression. The official reaction to the novel was O. Pravdyuk's article "On the Kurkul Road" in the "Krytika" magazine, where the author writes: "...From the very beginning, the poet became a singer of the Kurkul ideology and remains so to this day...".

                <h4>In prison and in exile</h4>
                On April 16, 1932, he was arrested in Kharkov and accused of "carrying out counter-revolutionary agitation" with the help of literary works, such as the poem "Ave Maria", the historical novel "Skelka", the poems "Shadow", "Vandea", "Gutenberg", social satire " Whip".
                
                He spent several months in solitary confinement in the internal prison of the GPU. And on October 25, 1932, he was released from custody and sent to special settlements in the Far East for three years. There is still little information about the period of Ivan Bagryany's stay in the Far East in 1932-1937: the Sea of ​​Okhotsk, the taiga, life among the Ukrainians of the Green Wedge. Escape to Ukraine and arrest on the way, a new term (3 years) — now in the BAMTAB camp.

                There are no exact data on the time of Ivan Bagryany's return from exile: on June 16, 1938, he was re-arrested, he was in Kharkiv UDB-NKVS prison on Kholodnaya Gora. A new charge was brought against him - participation or even leadership in a nationalist counter-revolutionary organization. Although long days of abuse and interrogations continued, I. Bagryany did not sign the act of ending the investigation on March 26, 1939 with the charges against him.In the resolution of April 1, 1940, it is stated that all the evidence about counter-revolutionary activities belong to the years 1928-1932, for which he was already convicted, and "...other data about the anti-Soviet activities of Bagryany-Lozovyaga were not obtained by the investigation." Sick, exhausted, Ivan Bagryany returned to Okhtyrka.

                Autobiographical details about these five years of life - arrest, torture, escape from exile and return to the homeland - the writer reflected in the novels "Garden of Gethsemane" and "Tiger Catchers".

                <h4>During World War II</h4>
                The Soviet-German war caught the writer in Okhtyrka. He immediately went into the Ukrainian underground, relocated to Galicia. Ivan Bagryany worked in the propaganda office, wrote songs on patriotic themes, articles of various nature, drew caricatures and propaganda posters. At the same time, he participated in the creation of the Ukrainian Main Liberation Council (UGVR), in the development of its program documents.

                Despite such a busy schedule, Ivan Bagryany did not abandon his literary work. In 1944, he wrote one of his most talented works - the novel "Beast Hunters" (later known as "Tiger Hunters").

                In January 1944, while staying in Ternopil, he wrote the poem "Walking Field".

                In March 1945, Bagryany was in the Carpathians in the village of Daba, together with the rest of the mission of the UGPR. In April 1945, when the Soviet troops began to approach the location of the group of Ukrainians, part of the members of the UGPR mission that did not travel with their families left for Zagreb, the capital of the Independent State of Croatia. A little later, Ivan Bagryany joined the group. In the capital of Croatia, the delegation of the UGPR delegation spent the whole of April, and this country also reflected on Ivan Bagryany's work. It was during this period that he wrote the novel "Lyuba" about the partisan struggle of the OUN/UPA, in which he himself had recently participated. In the text of the preserved passage, Croatian toponyms and phenomena often occur: the city of Varaždin, the Drava region, the Ustashi, the Chetniks of General Dragolyub Mykhailovych, who fought against the Ustashi. And the writer gave the title of the work in honor of Lyuba Komar, a radio operator of the mission of the UGPR, a participant in "Process 59" in 1941. The writer destroyed the manuscript of the novel with his own hands, because "he was angry with the heroes of this novel, the figures of the partisan resistance, my former friends, and later - the stunned heroes of the "camp states", my bitter enemies."

                <h4>In exile</h4>

                Grave of Ivan Bagryany in Novy Ulm (Germany)
                In 1945 Bagryany emigrated to Germany. As Yury Lavrinenko testifies in "Letters to Friends", "there was no freedom in emigration either. No less than prohibitions, Hitler's Germany prevented the formation of political emigration with all kinds of "Rosenberg headquarters", in which even very decent people were spoiled and compromised. Bagryany went to the West and emigrated through the "Ouniv underground".

                Ivan Bagryany wrote a brochure - a programmatic pamphlet for him "Why I don't want to return to the USSR?", where he laid out a political declaration of national dignity and the rights of a person who survived forced repatriation, violence, torture, humiliation as a former prisoner, ostarbeiter, captive, devoid of a proper name. He logically substantiated the regularity of emigration from the Soviet Union - the motherland, which committed genocide against its own people.In 1948, Bagryany founded the Ukrainian Revolutionary Democratic Party (URDP) and since then edited the newspaper "Ukrainian News" for 17 years - until his death. The writer was the head of the Executive Body of the Ukrainian National Council and deputy president of the Ukrainian People's Republic.

                Ivan Bagryany died on August 25, 1963. Buried in Neu-Ulmer Friedhof, an der Reuttier Str. in Neu-Ulmer Friedhof, Germany. The grave of Ivan Bagryany is the first on the left of the entrance to the cemetery, opposite the street. Finninger (Finninger Str.). The author of the grave monument is the sculptor Leo Mol. The monument on the grave was consecrated on October 3, 1965.

            <li id="third">Creativity</li> <hr>
            <p>Western researchers of Ivan Bagryany's work noted the writer's unique ability to "nightmarish grotesque", great humor in the midst of despair, optimism in the midst of tragedy in the dead war, which is being waged on the vast expanses of the Eurasian empire. Joseph Lobodovsky asserts that "Garden of Gethsemane" surpasses everything that has been written on this topic so far, on the other hand, it is a clear testimony of the deep humanism of the author, who at the very bottom of hell managed to see human signs even in the most brutal recluses."

                The popularity of another novel, "Tigrolovi", which Yuriy Sherekh considered to be the confirmation of the genre of the Ukrainian adventure novel, "Ukrainian in all its spirit, all direction, all ideas, feelings, characters", led to Mosendz and Klen's parody of the image of Baghryaniv's Grigory Mnogogrishny. This is how the humorous Gorotak appeared, which, according to Lavrinenko, was read rather as a harmless friendly cartoon. However, shortly before the writer's death, namely in 1963, a politically involved publicist book-pasquill "On the Literary Bazaar" appeared. Poetry, prose and journalism of Ivan Bagryany".
